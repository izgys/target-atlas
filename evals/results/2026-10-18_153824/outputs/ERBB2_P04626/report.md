## Druggability Assessment

**Overall score:** `high`  
**Structural confidence:** `high`  
**Chemical confidence:** `high`  
**Literature confidence:** `high`  

ERBB2 (HER2) is one of the most extensively validated oncology drug targets in existence, with 14 approved drugs, over 5,200 ChEMBL IC50 entries, 63 PDB structures (best resolution 1.25Å), and nearly 2,500 PubMed publications. The target has high-confidence structural, chemical, and literature support across multiple drug modalities including small molecules (kinase inhibitors), monoclonal antibodies, and antibody-drug conjugates. Druggability is unambiguously high.

### Evidence Gaps

- AlphaFold mean pLDDT of 74.0 (66.8% high-confidence fraction) suggests disordered regions exist — likely the extracellular domain linkers and intracellular unstructured segments — but this is well-compensated by abundant experimental PDB structures
- Only 9 of the top 20 PDB structures have ligand bound, meaning some crystal forms may not capture clinically relevant binding modes (e.g., allosteric sites, antibody epitopes)
- Resistance mechanisms (e.g., HER2 mutations, truncated p95-HER2, downstream pathway bypass) are well-documented but may limit efficacy of existing agents; novel agents targeting resistance are an active but still-evolving area
- Median IC50 of ~301 nM across ChEMBL entries indicates that many compounds in the dataset are moderate potency; selectivity profiles versus EGFR/ERBB4 are not captured here
- Emerging indications (bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, liver fibrosis) seen in recent literature reflect expanding biology but clinical validation in non-breast/gastric settings is still maturing

### Reasoning Trace

Step 1 — Structural confidence: 63 PDB entries with a best resolution of 1.25Å (X-ray crystallography) is exceptional. 9 of the top 20 structures have a bound ligand, confirming druggable binding pockets have been experimentally captured. AlphaFold pLDDT of 74.0 (mean) with 66.8% high-confidence fraction is modest but largely irrelevant given the wealth of experimental structures. Structural confidence = HIGH.

Step 2 — Chemical confidence: 5,265 IC50 entries in ChEMBL (far exceeding the 1,000 threshold), a median IC50 of 301 nM (indicating tractable potency across the dataset), and 14 approved drugs spanning small molecules (lapatinib, afatinib, neratinib, tucatinib), monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab, pertuzumab), and ADCs (trastuzumab emtansine/deruxtecan) make this an unambiguous high-confidence chemical target. Multiple drug modalities have succeeded clinically. Chemical confidence = HIGH.

Step 3 — Literature confidence: 2,443 PubMed papers with ERBB2 in the title, with active publications in 2026, covering diverse cancer types, resistance mechanisms, novel therapeutic combinations, and emerging non-oncology biology (fibrosis, inflammation). Disease association is not hypothesis-level — it is causal (gene amplification/overexpression is a driver in breast, gastric, and other cancers). Literature confidence = HIGH.

Step 4 — Evidence gaps: The main gaps are (a) modest AlphaFold confidence in disordered regions (mitigated by PDB data), (b) resistance mechanisms that remain a clinical challenge, (c) selectivity data not available in this dataset, (d) expanding indications not yet fully validated clinically.

Step 5 — Overall druggability: ERBB2 is a textbook druggable target. Multiple approved drugs across multiple modalities, extensive structural and chemical data, and strong disease causal evidence collectively support a HIGH druggability score with no meaningful uncertainty.
