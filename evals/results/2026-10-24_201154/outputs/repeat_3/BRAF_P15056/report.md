## Druggability Assessment

**Overall score:** `high`  
**Structural confidence:** `high`  
**Chemical confidence:** `high`  
**Literature confidence:** `high`  

BRAF (P15056) is one of the most extensively validated oncology drug targets in human medicine, with 5 approved small-molecule inhibitors, over 11,000 ChEMBL IC50 entries, and 138 PDB structures including many at high resolution with bound ligands. The target is highly druggable across multiple cancer indications driven by activating mutations (notably V600E), with a rich chemical and structural landscape supporting further drug discovery efforts.

### Evidence Gaps

- AlphaFold mean pLDDT of 66.4 (55% high-confidence fraction) suggests disordered regions outside the kinase domain, but this does not limit druggability given the wealth of experimental structures
- Resistance mechanisms (e.g., paradoxical MAPK activation, splice variants, BRAF amplification) remain an active challenge not fully addressed by current approved drugs
- Coverage of non-V600 BRAF mutants (class II and III) in structural and chemical datasets may be less comprehensive than V600E
- Allosteric and dimer-interface inhibitor strategies are still emerging and less well-characterised chemically compared to ATP-competitive inhibitors
- Combination therapy optimal partners and sequencing strategies are not fully resolved in all tumour types

### Reasoning Trace

Step 1 — Structural confidence: 138 PDB entries with the best resolution at 1.5 Å (X-ray crystallography) and 18/20 top structures containing bound ligands. This is an exceptionally rich structural dataset. The AlphaFold mean pLDDT of 66.4 reflects disordered regions (likely the N-terminal regulatory domain and activation loop in certain states), but this is irrelevant to druggability given the experimental structure coverage. Structural confidence = HIGH.

Step 2 — Chemical confidence: 11,017 IC50 entries in ChEMBL with a median IC50 of 173.5 nM indicates a very large and potent chemical dataset. Five approved drugs (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib, sorafenib, regorafenib) confirm clinical translation. Chemical confidence = HIGH.

Step 3 — Literature confidence: 7,320 PubMed titles containing 'BRAF', with active 2026 publications spanning multiple cancer types (colorectal, thyroid, biliary tract, craniopharyngioma, lung). This reflects deep, sustained, and clinically relevant research activity. Literature confidence = HIGH.

Step 4 — Druggability assessment: BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase with a well-defined ATP-binding pocket that has been successfully exploited by multiple approved drugs. The V600E mutation (constitutively active) is the primary oncogenic driver in melanoma (~50%), papillary thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer, and others. The target has demonstrated clinical benefit across multiple tumour types. Resistance is a known challenge but is being addressed by next-generation inhibitors and combination strategies. There are no significant druggability concerns — the target is highly tractable. Druggability score = HIGH.

Step 5 — Evidence gaps: The main gaps are not in basic druggability but in addressing resistance (splice variants, paradoxical activation, dimerisation-driven resistance), non-V600 mutant coverage, and optimising combination regimens. The disordered AlphaFold regions are a minor note but do not affect the overall assessment given experimental structure availability.
